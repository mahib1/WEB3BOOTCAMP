  \chapter{WEB3CAMP}
      This year , we are back with the web3bootcamp. This has been an ongoing event since the last few years, but due to covid, we had to conduct it online
      and this year, we are back with an offline one in a long time!\\\\
      when we learn coding, we always learn the common languages like c++ , java, js, html etc , but we don't bother learning the newer languages and that is what we need to try because of the low risk high reward structure of the activity\\\\
